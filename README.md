# Dox-ray

Dox-ray is a node module which can parse special code comments and return
an array of objects containing document/code pairs. Comments are written in YAML
and parsed into structured objects. The YAML structure is up to you. You define
the documentation properties that's right for your code. Dox-ray can also
write to a JSON file which you can use to build completely client-side
documentation sites that won't slow down your task runner.

Note that this project is currently in Beta.

## Getting started

### Install

```bash
npm install https://github.com/himedlooff/dox-ray/archive/0.1.0.tar.gz
```

### Usage

_Example files to come shortly._

```js
// Create an instance of CommentDocs.
var CommentDocs = require('comment-docs');
var docMaker = new CommentDocs();

// Parse a file and get back an array of document/code pairs.
var docs = docMaker.parse( 'styles.css' );

// Write it to a JSON file.
docMaker.writeJSON( docs, 'styles.json' );

// You can "merge" files as well. This is handy when you have a source file like
// a Less file that gets compiled into a CSS file and you want access to both
// the Less and CSS for your documentation. The second parameter is the
// top-level property to match in the YAML comments.
var docs = docMaker.parse( ['styles.css', 'styles.less'], 'name' );
```
